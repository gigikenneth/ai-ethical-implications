# Code of Conduct

Our project values collaboration and diversity, and we are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone who contributes to this project. We pledge to respect all people who participate, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

We encourage all contributors to actively engage in discussions and share their perspectives, ideas, and expertise. We believe that a diverse community leads to better ideas and outcomes, and we are committed to creating an environment where all voices are heard.

## Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Encouraging and uplifting others in the community

## Examples of behavior that are not acceptable include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks or insults
- Trolling or derogatory comments
- Harassment of any kind
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [gigikenneth7@gmail.com](mailto:gigikenneth7@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
