# CONTRIBUTOR GUIDELINES

**Step 1:** Source for available/ accessible AI documents for a country (available countries are listed in this [issue](https://github.com/gigikenneth/ai-ethical-implications/issues)).
- You can find some of the AI policy and strategy documents on [OECD's live repository](https://oecd.ai/en/dashboards/overview) (but please check online 
as some of the documents haven't been updated on there yet, such as Qatar's AI strategy document).

**Step 2:** Read or scan through the policy document to see what topics the policy document addresses (some of them
can be very long).

**Step 3:** Make a copy of the [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11IXrDDZxfZCl0T3f4_nWHrAmMBIKkLOWHXjhDOWaWyE/edit?usp=sharing) state the name of the country, year of publication of the document and link to the document.

Sort the content of the document using the available categories these include:
- Healthcare
- Finance
- Education
- Transportation
- Agriculture
- Infrastructure
- Startups/ Tech Ecosystem
- Data Privacy & Public Rights Protection
- Regulations on Private & Public AI Solution Providers
- Others (for any other important aspect of the document that I couldnâ€™t place under the above topics)

**Step 4:** Summarize the document under the available categories. *(Please feel free to leave your personal notes that you
feel are important to include for everyone else to see in Italics)*.

**Step 5:** Download your spreadsheet and upload it to the [POLICY SUMMARIES](https://github.com/gigikenneth/ai-ethical-implications/tree/main/POLICY%20SUMMARIES) folder.

**Step 6:** When pushing your submission, please leave a quick description of what you worked on especially if you worked on 
multiple countries or made an update to an existing submission.

You can find the Board that covers the to-do's for this project [here](https://github.com/users/gigikenneth/projects/3/views/1?layout=board).
